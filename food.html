    <p><strong>Some of my personal favourite food spots around my city.</strong></p>

    <!-- This will be a list of landmarks. Each link should open in a new tab to the wikipedia pages. -->
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="https://glasgow.chaiiwala.co.uk/catalogue" target="_blank">Chaiiwala</a>
            <p>A tea spot popular amongst much of the south-asian community, known for the pretty ambience and relaxed atmosphere.</p>

        <li>
            <a href="https://www.primalfeast.co.uk/" target="_blank">Primal Feast</a>
            <p>Smash-burgers are taking off in Glasgow, and this is one of my go-to spots.
                 I part-time here, and a friend owns the business, so I might be slightly biased, but I love burgers.</p>
